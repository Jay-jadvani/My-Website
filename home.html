             <h2 style="color: aqua;">History</h2>
             <h3 style="text-align: center;">The shrine proper of the Sun Temple was built during the reign of Bhima I of Chaulukya dynasty.<br> Earlier, during 1024–1025, Mahmud of Ghazni had invaded Bhima's kingdom, and a force of around 20,000 soldiers had unsuccessfully tried to check his advance at Modhera.<br> Historian A. K. Majumdar theorizes that the Sun Temple might have been built to commemorate this defense.<br>[5] On a block in western wall of cella, there is an inscription "Vikram Samvat 1083" upside down carelessly incised in Devnagari script which correspond to 1026-1027 CE.<br> No other date is found. As the inscription is upside down, it evidences the destruction and reconstruction of the cella.<br> Due to the position of the inscription, it is not firmly considered as the date of construction. On the stylistic ground,<br> it is known that the Kunda with its corner shrines was built earlier at the beginning of the 11th century.<br> The inscription is rather considered as the date of destruction by Ghazni instead of the construction.<br> Soon after Bhima had returned to the power. So the temple proper, the miniature and the niche shrines in the tank were built shortly after 1026 CE.<br> The dancing hall was added much later in the third quarter of the 12th century along with the gateways,<br> the porch of the temple proper and the doorframes of the temple and the cella during the reign of the Karna.[6]

                <br>The temple is built on 23.6° latitude (approximately near Tropic of Cancer).<br> The place was later known as Sita ni Chauri and Ramkund locally.<br> No worship is offered here now.</h3>

                <h3 style="text-align: center;">The Somnath temple, also called Somanātha temple or Deo Patan,<br> is a Hindu temple located in Prabhas Patan, Veraval in Gujarat, India.<br> It is one of the most sacred pilgrimage sites for Hindus and is believed to be first among the twelve jyotirlinga shrines of Shiva.<br> It is unclear when the first version of the Somnath temple was built with estimates varying between the early centuries of the 1st-millennium to about the 9th-century CE.<br> The temple is not mentioned in ancient Sanskrit texts of Hinduism as Somnath nomenclature but<br> the "Prabhasa-Pattana" (Prabhas Patan) is mentioned as a tirtha (pilgrimage site), where this temple exists.<br>

            <h3 style="text-align: center;">The Dwarkadhish temple, also known as the Jagat Mandir and occasionally spelled Dwarakadheesh,<br> is a Hindu temple dedicated to Krishna, who is worshiped here by the name Dwarkadhish,<br> or 'King of Dwarka'. The temple is located at Dwarka city of Gujarat, India, which is one of the destinations of Char Dham,<br> a Hindu pilgrimage circuit. The main shrine of the five-storied building, supported by 72 pillars,<br> is known as Jagat Mandir or Nija Mandir. Archaeological findings suggest the original temple was built in 200 BCE at the earliest.<br>[1][2][3] The temple was rebuilt and enlarged in the 15th-16th century.<br>[4][5]

                According to tradition, the original temple was believed to have been built by Krishna's grandson, Vajranabha, over the hari-griha (Krishna's residential place).<br> The original structure was destroyed by Mahmud Begada in 1472,<br> and subsequently rebuilt in the 15th-16th century,[citation needed] in the Māru-Gurjara style.<br>
                
                The temple became part of the Char Dham pilgrimage considered sacred by Hindus in India.<br> Adi Shankaracharya, the 8th century Hindu theologian and philosopher,<br> visited the shrine. The other three being comprising Rameswaram, Badrinath and Pur</h3>
